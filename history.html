              <h3>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</h3>
              <p>
                The Maragtas Legend tells the history of Iloilo way back in the 13th century, when Datu Puti and his
                fellow Datus, together with their families, warriors and slaves fled from the tyranny of Sultan
                Makatunao of Borneo and landed at the mouth of the Sirawag River, now known as the town of San Joaquin
                and eventually settled there.
              </p>
              <p>At that time, people called the “Atis” who were ruled by King Marikudo and Queen Maniwangtiwang,
                inhabited Panay. King Marikudo bartered the lowlands of Panay Island for a golden hat, “saduk”, and a
                long gold necklace, “manangyad”, and other assorted gifts to the Bornean Datus. The latter then took
                complete control of the island with the “Atis” retiring to the mountains. It was Datu Paiburong who was
                assigned in Irong-Irong (shaped like a nose), which was later known as Iloilo.</p>

            <p>
              Panay Island was ruled under the Code of Kalantiao, where peace and prosperity reigned for 300 years. But
              this was disrupted when the Spaniards came and established the provincial government.

              Municipio de Iloilo, became a city under the Bacura Law in 1893; and in 1896, the King of Spain cited the
              City of Iloilo “la muy leal”, and “noble ciudad de Iloilo”, in recognition of the loyalty of her people to
              the Spanish Government.
            </p>
            <p>When the Philippine Revolution started, the Panay uprising against the Spaniards was led by Gen. Martin
              Delgado of Sta. Barbara, who liberated all towns except Iloilo City, Molo, and Jaro. December 28, 1898
              marked the arrival of the Americans at the Iloilo port, and on April 11, 1901, Iloilo city whose status
              has reverted to municipality, became the chief port and trading center of Panay and Negros. Because it
              progressed steadily, the Commonwealth Act No. 158 incorporated the surrounding towns of Lapaz, Jaro,
              Mandurriao and Arevalo to form Iloilo City and was finally inaugurated on August 25, 1937, and was dubbed
              as the “Queen City of the South”, Gen. Martin Delgado became the first governor of the Province of Iloilo.

          <h3 class="mt-5" style="font-weight: bold;">HERITAGE</h3>
          <p>
            Iloilo has always been one of the country’s most important provinces. Merchants from China and India have
            long
            traded with the Ilonggos even before the Spaniards came; evidences of this flourishing civilization are
            displayed in Museums and Private Galleries. Even during the Spanish and American colonial period, Iloilo
            still
            proved to be an important trading post. Iloilo has a beautiful harbor with serene and calm waters, safe for
            navigation because it is protected from the open sea by scenic Guimaras Island. This excellent port facility
            made Iloilo the center of trade at the turn of the century, with the whole world doing business in this port
            especially during the heyday of the sugar industry. In fact, Iloilo was given the title of “Queen City of
            the
            South” for being the Philippine’s second city, after Manila.
          </p>
          <p>You can still see the old buildings that surprisingly are European and American inspired such as stately
            mansions, majestic century-old churches, and heritage commercial buildings.

            Iloilo’s rich heritage is showcased in multifarious festivals celebrated in the city and various towns of
            the
            province. Dubbed as the “Province of Festivals“, Iloilo is proud of its nationally acclaimed Dinagyang
            Festival, together with smaller but similarly riveting festivities in the province, blends the pagan and the
            Christian in a street dance masquerade honoring Sto. Nino.
          </p>

          <h3 class="mt-5 style=" style="font-weight: bold;">NATURAL RESOURCES</h3>
          <p>
            Iloilo is endowed with natural wonders. Highland attractions from the cascades and waterfalls of the
            mountains
            of Iloilo to rice terraces and heights in its hinder lands. Worth visiting are various islands and islets of
            Iloilo that abound with white sand beaches and ornamented with tropical palms. Experience breezy fun while
            on
            an island hopping getaway. Explorations in Iloilo’s northern coast such as the mysterious caves of Gigantes
            island and the sea charms of Sicogon and nearby islets, as well as the splendid silhouette of Pan de Azucar
            in
            Concepcion town herald quaint stories and enchanting folklores.
          </p>
          <p>Iloilo takes pride in being the Food basket and Rice Granary of the Region owing to its fertile lands and
            seas that yield plentiful harvest. Rice is the major crop in the province of Iloilo. Fish and marine
            products
            are considered the main source of livelihood in the southern and northern Iloilo. Tourists will find many
            restaurants offering a gastronomic treat of fresh sea foods and famous Ilonggo dishes such as La Paz
            Batchoy,
            Chicken Inasal, and Pancit Molo.
          </p>

          <h3 class="mt-5 style=" style="font-weight: bold;">TOURISM</h3>

            that the whole of Iloilo offers is their hospitality.
          </p>

            and Palawan and the nearby provinces of Guimaras, Antique, Capiz, and Aklan.</p>

          <h3 class="mt-5 style=" style="font-weight: bold;">PEOPLE AND LANGUAGE</h3>
          <p>
            People from Iloilo are called Ilonggos. They are known for their charm and sweetness that comes from the
            musical to nation of their dialect, Hiligaynon. You would not be able to tell if an Ilonggo is mad at you by
            the way they speak, which always sounds like someone crooning a love song to you. Kiniray-a, which is a
            dialect very similar to Hiligaynon is used in Iloilo’s country sides. English and Tagalog are also widely
            spoken and understood especially in urban areas.
